<h1>Feedback</h1>
<ul>
	<li>It looks like you may need some more time on your project or some additional pointers.</li>
	<li> We didn’t see a few of the requirements such as an about or contact page.</li>
	<li> None of your images are loading in the page properly and there may be some issues in your CSS. All of these things are fixable.</li>
	<li> All of the image links are assuming that you have an images folder which I don’t see in your project. You should update those image links with just the file names.</li>
    <li>Check back through the CSS for missing semicolons or colons. This can cause your styles to render improperly.</li>
    <li>Good start including the form and working out your home page, as well as working with different list item styles. Keep working on it</li>
